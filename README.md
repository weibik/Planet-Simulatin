# Planet Simulation
### A simple planetary simulation using the Pygame library. This simulation depicts the motion of planets under the influence of gravitational forces.

## Features
- Planets are represented as objects with mass, position, velocity, and orbit.
- Gravitational forces are calculated based on Newton's law of gravitation.
- Planets move in their orbits, and their positions are updated in each frame.
- The Sun is placed at the center of the window and has a significant mass.
- The simulation includes Earth, Mars, Mercury, and Venus, each with its unique properties.

## Dependencies
- Pygame: A cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games.

## Installation 
Install the Pygame library
`pip install pygame`

Run the simulation
`python main.py`
